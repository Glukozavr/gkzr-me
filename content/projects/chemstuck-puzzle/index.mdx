    <h1>Prepare to Chemstuck!</h1>
</div>

Chemstuck Puzzle is a wordplay - it's about playing around in a chemistry lab stacking up different ingredients to get
results! And you can really get stuck in that lab for quite some time. You will learn the abstract set of rules,
how to get different substances from available to you basic ingredients and the list of tasks from your professor A
to mix up.
